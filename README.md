This project can be successfully executed by pasting any text into a .txt file and then path that .txt file to 
```Python
file-name = 'your-file.txt' 
``` 
in line 18 of the script.
 >You can also adjust the length of your list by changing the numbers in the fields labeled "[:10]" in lines 31, 35 and 39. Like:
 ```Python
 for word, number in word_list[:10]
 ``` 
 >Finally, with this tool you can get information about how many words are in a text, how many different words there are, etc. 

I would appreciate a star :)
