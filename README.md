#  The most used words in the text

##  You can list the most used words and binary and ternary phrases in a .txt file of your choice.

Hello everyone. I am with you with my new project :) From now on, I will share the projects I made during my learning adventure about Python and its frameworks in this repo and if you find anything useful, you can use it with pleasure. Have fun in advance. Take care :)

This project can be successfully executed by pasting any text into a .txt file and then addressing that .txt file to file-name = 'your-file.txt' in line 18 of the script. You can also adjust the length of your list by changing the numbers in the fields labeled "[:10]" in lines 31, 35 and 39. Finally, with this tool you can get information about how many words are in a text, how many different words there are, etc. 

I would appreciate a star :)
